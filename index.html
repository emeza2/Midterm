        <p>Hi my name is Esther Meza. I am curently a student at Ohlone college and I am working on learning about graphic design and also on how to make websites. Here are three of the most proudest art works I made of my friends and one of my friends mothers. I dont just make self portraits. I also have worked on making logos, flyers, artical formats, and I am still curently learning more things but by you asking me to make something for you it will help me with making money and also learning more in the process. Im a hard worker and I alwasy bring something good to the Meza.
